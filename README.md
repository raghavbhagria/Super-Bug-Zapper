Super Bug Zapper is an interactive 3D game developed using WebGL, where players engage in a dynamic battle against invading bacteria. Set within a unique environment, bacteria spawn on the surfaces of a rotating 3D cube. Players must strategically click on these bacteria to zap them away and prevent an outbreak. The game harnesses HTML and JavaScript for smooth gameplay and is supported by additional resources located in the accompanying lib folder in the repository.
